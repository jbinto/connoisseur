## Purpose

This is a simple command line tool to communicate with [lcboapi.com](http://lcboapi.com).

It demonstrates some of the following concepts:

* Consuming RESTful web services
* Opening URIs in Ruby
* Handling JSON data
* A very basic "router" (as in Rails "routes")

## Usage

    ruby connoisseur.rb index > index.html
    # Open index.html in your favorite browser
